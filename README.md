Transistor.fm Archival Tool

Uses Transistor.fm's api to download episodes with consistent title formatting based on information provided by the API.  The program can be configured to have a different titling format or download a different number of episodes at the users discretion. Areas of the code that need to be changed by the user are singled out with comments, the user must provide their own API key and show ID.
